# Blossom
Blossom is a programming language I made for fun and to learn C++ at the same time. Blossom is currently in WIP. Contributions will be much appreciated.

## The Goal
Blossom aims to be a language with a good grammar, that is fast and has the possibility to convert code into other languages (ex C++ or Python).

## Basic Sythax
Blossom's current sythax looks like this:
```
print("hello fellow programmers");
```

As Blossom is currently in WIP, the synthax might change but the updated sythax will always be there.

## How to use
In order to use Blossom you need to create a Blossom file that has one of those file extensions:

| Extension  | Use Case |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| .blo  | Normal Blossom File  |
| .blossom  | Normal Blossom File  |

You can then start writing Blossom Code!

For Example, Hello world looks like this in Blossom:
```
print("hello world");
```

You cannot currently run your code but this will come very soon.
